Some websites have so many information to show you that they asked for specific things that you want so they can make a filter of that huge information. That way show you only whats important to you.
Ask the user to make decisions --> then give information.

1.3 Getting Started
=====================

The small test - any testing is better than none
Get a person and put in front of the website that we are developing then ask what he will do next.

The big test - get a baseline
Requires more persons with diferent porpouses. 
Get a bigger and diverse group of users.
Get in front of the aplication for a big period of time that way we get more results.

Going forward - feature by feature testing
Take a person and try something that is problamatic in your website.
Listen that person.
