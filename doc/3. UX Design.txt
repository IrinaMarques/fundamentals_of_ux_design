Paper Wireframes

Iterating: 
Process of taking a wireframe --> show to someone --> discussing it --> agree on changings --> next version (moving elements) and get more detail
--> show that version to more people --> get more feedback --> Repeat

Don't get attached

3.4 Getting Buy-In
====================

Take matters into your own hands.

Create a UX Process document:
How do you intent on doing this

Work with users and get feedback

Be the evangelist

Share your successes

Be patient

=======================================================
3.5 User Experience and Project Management Methodology
=======================================================

Working with a Project management:
UX Design it's new to a lot of organizations.

"Waterfall" methodology:
Is a sequencial design proccess 
- Requirements --> User Testing and Analysis --> Design --> Implementation --> Maintenance

Allow more time for careful analysis
Less flexibility in rolling out fixes quickly
Be careful about prioritizing fixes, since you have less ability to roll them out quickly
Plan for detailed deliverables and careul analysis documents

Agile UX:
Things can be fast and furious
Fixes can be implemented quickly, or take more time if they're larger
Rapid turnaround times allows for real life feedback, which can decrease the need for the in-depth sutdies before deplying
Less detailed deliverables

Lean UX:
Low fidelity deliverables
Collaborative brainstorming/design
People and ideas over deliverables
