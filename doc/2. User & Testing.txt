=================================
2.1 Find Out Who your Users Are
=================================

- Getting data: We can't design a good user experience without knowing who our users are.

- Metrics Tools:
Google analytics
Piwik
Crazy Egg
Kiss Metrics
Loopfuse
Spring Metrics

- Demographics: Know where people are from.

- Technical Capabilities: Design for several screens.
Most commonly used browser/operating system combinations
Device type
Screen size
Contexts whre device is commonly used

=======================
2.2 Creating Personas
=======================

What's a user persona?
Users for design planing means. 
Fictitious person. 
Share characteristics based on research and knowledge that you already have about them.
Help keep foucus on the goals and needs of your users.

Creating a persona:

What's a 'win' state in your website?
What task constitutes a successful use.

Different type of users:
Expert
Intermediate
Beginner
Novice

Create a list of tasks that someone can do in the site. Then organize by difficulty.

How familiar is this person...
With the tasks in your application?
With applications in general?
With internet in general?
With computers in general?

Backstory:
Important to know the motivation in using the site/app

Make a template:
With an image.
Name
Physical location
Age
Profession
Language
Computer Experience
Knowledge of the business domain
Physical limitations

================================
2.3 Identify Usability Problems
================================

How to know a usability problem?
A point here a user express frustration or be unable to complete a task.

Taking too long.
How long can the people spending in the page?

Begin with the obvious.

When work with users in person listen for the negative:
- The font
- The color
- "I can't get out of here!"

Words of questioning - listen for uncertaintly:
- What do these pictures means?
- I'm not sure
- Where do I go next?

=======================
2.4 Prioritizing Work
=======================

Not all problems are created equal
- hight impact
- low impact

- hard to implement
- easy to implement

Look first for the quick wins - the ones easy to fix.
Long term goals
Back Burner - the harder ones

======================
2.5 Designing a Test
======================

Careful what users want.

Coming up with a testing plan.


Testing styles - Naturalistic vs. Task oriented:

- Task oriented give the users a list of guide lines and see were it goes. Give anexample task -e.g. "Complete this form", or "Sign up for an account". The tester would give the user directions, to keep them doing on the desired path, and not allow them to wander off.
- The Naturalistic Questions: Tester don't guide the user only observe what they are doing.
Where would you go next? What do you think that does? How does that make you feel? What would you like it to do? 


Remote vs in-person:

- Type 1: In person moderated
Sitting down with the user and looking at the screen with them
- Type 2: In person, unmoderated
Software records their action and observe behind a mirror.
- Type 3: Remote, moderated
Skype or webassembly, working with the user in real time.
- Type 4: Remote, unmoderated.
Using a servece like testing.com, records sound and screen of the user but was no interaction.

=======================
2.6 Working with users
=======================

- Recruting users:
Depends the project and organization.
Thru the website with an announcement
Twitter
Facebook
Linkdln
Craigslist
Your company blog

- A brief word on scheduling:
Sometimes in a day we'll do several sessions, leave pleanty of room between sessions. 

- The legal Stuff:
Be aware of the legal stuff.

- Structuring & Conduction the Session:
Running a Session ask for honest feedback 
Be friendly and confident. 
Be mindful of language
Take notes and observe
No technobabble - use simple terms.
No leading
